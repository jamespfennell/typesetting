# Next steps

- Make `def` into an `ExecutionCommand` and set 
    everything up.
    
- Next, need to think adding new scopes during the
    expansion process through `{` and `}` symbols.
    It seems expansion can't be fully detached
    from things like parsing variable names and
    scoping?
    This will have repercussions for `\edef`.
