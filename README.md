# Typesetting repo

This work-in-progress repo hosts a collection of interelated Go packages
related to typesetting.
The first package will be a full implementation of the Knuth-Plass
algorithm for line breaking.
Depending on motivation this repo will eventually contains a full
implementation of Tex in Go...!
